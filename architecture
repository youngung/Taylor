## Architecture of my Talor

- Rate independent and dependent

- Python's gorgeous interface should be made use of

- Input arguments should be done using class

- Should be done so on utput (simulation data) as well


- input: RVE, single crystal properties.
- output: pole figure, stress - strain
- others should be nothing more than scripts making use of the very fundamental frame.
