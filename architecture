## Architecture of my Taylor (1938)

- Objectives:
 Rate independent and dependent
 Python's gorgeous interface should be made use of
 Input arguments should be done using class
 Should be done so on output (simulation data) as well


- input: RVE, single crystal properties.
- output: pole figure, stress - strain
- others should be nothing more than scripts making use of the very fundamental frame.


- input class:
 RVE
 single crystal properties (slip system, hardening and so on)
  
- output class:
 Full tensorial Stress - strain
 output RVE

- Numerical modules (or definitions)
 1. Stress calculation
 2. Slip system's shear strain amount
 3. CRSS evolution
 4. Grain evolution
